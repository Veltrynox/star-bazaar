# Main agent blackboard

## Do not repeat
- Do not flip discovery_enabled in data/balance.json to fix tests: it ships at 0 on purpose (gdd.md); tests set it themselves.

## Left to do
- Open: T184, T185, T186, T187, T188 (unblocked now), T176, T178/T182 (owner-only agents), T05, T166.

## 2026-11-05 run: T183
- Summary: The 15 test failures were stale test expectations, not game bugs. Discovery ships off (balance discovery_enabled 0), but the tests' discovery-on helper only switched it off, never on; and the save VERSION tests still said 6 (now 7). Fixed in tools/tests/run_tests.gd.
- Why this task: first in queue, unblocks T188, small and certain.
- Approach: fix tests, not code or balance, since the off default is documented in gdd.md.
- Agent prompts: none, edit done directly (two small changes).
- Worked: sh tools/tests/run.sh pass=1915 fail=0.
- Failed / did not work: the "Parse JSON failed" log line is a deliberate bad-file test, not a failure. No handoff file written (no agent used).
- Files and commits: tools/tests/run_tests.gd, schedule.json, blackboard.md.
- Left to do: nothing for T183.
